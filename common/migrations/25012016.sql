Some of the highest rated places in the area had month long waits and I didn&#39;t want to wait a month for my appointment. So, I did a bit of research and this place was right by my house, so I called and they got me in the next day. That was a big plus for me.<br><br>It seems like they mainly cater to children, they have a playroom and there are cartoons playing above your chair when they bring you back. I saw some kids leaving with helium balloons too (I was a bit sad I didn&#39;t get one, actually). Obviously, they also treat adults, but you do feel a bit out of place there as an adult. <br><br>The staff at the desk are super nice. The doctor is really nice too. She just moved from Michigan, which we had in common, so while it was odd to have a conversation while getting my teeth cleaned, it was also kind of cool to have a dentist that was willing to get to know her patients a bit. Unfortunately, there were some down sides as well. They are understaffed, so I had to wait nearly 2 hours before the cleaning actually began and then I found out I had a cavity. Once the cleaning began, however, everything went pretty quickly. The doc did quick work cleaning my teeth and then filling my cavity. Also, I didn&#39;t feel a thing on the cavity side once the numbing stuff kicked in. She wasn&#39;t exactly gentle with the cleaning though. Granted, it&#39;d been a long time since I&#39;d been to the dentist (no insurance will do that), so I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t going to be very comfortable anyway, she was rushing because of the fact they were understaffed and she had other patients to get to. It wasn&#39;t overly painful, but it didn&#39;t feel good. I think if they&#39;d had more staff and she wasn&#39;t in such a rush, this wouldn&#39;t have been an issue and they&#39;d have gotten an extra star. Also, at the end of the appointment, I felt like I missed some kind of finish up time with the doctor where I could ask some questions because she had a child in the next chair waiting for a procedure. <br><br>I believe if they get some more staff, it&#39;d be a really good place to go.

There was no longer enough room for her tongue and this crowded the airway. Her teeth and jaws became more misaligned and chewing became difficult.  Doctors said she had exercise induced asthma.  Worse, some said there was nothing wrong with her!  She had so much trouble getting air that she developed sleep apnea and acute anxiety.  She could no longer participate in aerobic activities.  Our once active, healthy little girl became more withdrawn and suffered from situational depression as her health deteriorated.  A year ago, we met with a top dentist in Seattle who took one look at her and said:  &#34;Oh my gosh!  I don&#39;t know how she can breathe!  Her upper airway is almost completely blocked.&#34;  The dentist referred us to Dr. William Hang, an orthodontist specializing in non-retractive orthodontics.  He knows that retractive orthodontics can severely impair the upper airway in some patients.  After examination, he referred us to Dr. Wolford because it was too late to correct our daughter with just orthodontics.   Dr. Wolford ordered an MRI immediately and after a thorough examination he could see that she had only 20 to 50% of a normal upper airway.  He prepared a surgical plan that included the need for six months of non-retractive orthodontics to pull the teeth forward and align them prior to surgery.  The goals were to ensure: excellent breathing, proper chewing and swallowing function, and facial balance for a lifetime of improved health.  (One dentist had told me that he meets patients all the time who have had double-jaw surgery.  They often have poor breathing and chewing function and look terrible.)  It was our goal to prevent that from happening.  I continued to research.  Dr. Wolford continued to come to the top of the list and was repeatedly known by experts from around the globe as: &#34;Simply THE BEST!&#34;  --We also went to the Sleep Medicine Lab at Stanford Medical Center to see the renowned Dr. Christian Guilleminault.  He confirmed our daughter had terrible sleep apnea and the same chronic, blocked breathing problems and misalignment issues that Dr. Wolford had diagnosed. Our daughter had surgery three weeks ago.  Yesterday, she went back to school.  She woke up from surgery being able to breathe fully for the first time in 5 years.  She no longer has severe headaches from lack of oxygen and misalignment of her jaws.  Her orthognathic surgery has proven to be transformational.  Dr. Wolford said that he not only wanted to operate on our daughter to correct her double-jaw and breathing problems, but to turn her life around; to give her back her happy, healthy life!  He did!  That is priceless!!!  Our daughter says she loves her new face AND, she feels CHEERFUL and ENERGETIC!!!  She hasn&#39;t said that in years.  When she told another young, prospective patient of Dr. Wolford&#39;s that she awakened from surgery without a headache for the first time in two years, the other patient burst into tears.  She hoped she could find the same relief.  Dr. Wolford is the most dedicated, compassionate, caring, constantly learning, innovating, humanitarian you could ever meet.  His life is devoted to helping his patients get back their happy, productive lives.  He constantly innovates and improves on the devices he has invented and the technological advances he has brought to the field.  He has earned his reputation and also has the most extraordinary surgical team imaginable.  Denise Wolford is the outstanding woman behind the outstanding man.  She may be short at times and she usually prefers email over calls, but she is warm, caring, and attentive to their patients.  She greets us with reassuring open arms and hugs every time we visit the office, even though they have a very large and busy practice.  They are a fantastic team and parents to 5 incredible kids, too.  We could not be happier with the results and our daughter&#39;s phenomenal outcome is everything!   Dr. Wolford is:  &#34;Simply THE BEST!&#34;', '', '2016-01-24 21:43:18'),

In need of a serious cleaning, x-rays, a few fillings and an implant, I finally visited his office at the strong suggestion of a dear friend. I&#39;m so glad I did. <br><br>Firstly, Dr. Clemetson&#39;s staff is caring, well-humored and deeply professional. No waiting around for my appointment, no fuss. My x-Rays were taken with great care to avoid discomfort, and clear photographs to assist in the following discussion, in layperson terms, with the doctor regarding the condition and needs of my teeth. That talk was clear and open, with a great deal of emphasis placed on preventive, rather than reparative, care. As Dr. Clemetson said, &#34;I want you to spend more time in my hygienist&#39;s chair, than in my chair.&#34; Advice was provided about better methods for cleaning/brushing at home, including how to determine what floss is best for me. Thorough, to say the least!<br><br>A very good point to mention is that this practice believes in comfort being just as important as effective procedure. All methods of sedation are available, from nitrous oxide (that&#39;s for my level of wimpishness) to full anesthesia (for those on the serious end of the spectrum). It&#39;s getting difficult enough to find dentists who still offer NO, so this, combined with the overall office philosophy, was a huge positive sign for me. <br><br>I&#39;m scheduled for my cleaning next week, and those pesky fillings are soon to follow. And frankly, it feels great to look ahead to both with no sense of dread- I sense that I&#39;m in very good hands. Hell, even that long-delayed implant doesn&#39;t scare me, any more.

Before entering any place of business, I find myself compulsively checking Yelp, Google Local, etc to ensure that I&#39;m purchasing my shoelaces from the most reputable establishment.<br><br>This is why I felt very apprehensive about visiting Hebron Smiles on Saturday. In an attempt to practice good oral hygiene, I pulled out a very large filling on my back molar whilst flossing. My mind went into survival mode. Without thinking (or yelping), I immediately made my way next-door  to &#39;that one dentist office&#39; that I passed by on many trips to satiate my caffeine addiction or for the occasional mani/pedi. <br><br>I was greeted warmly by the woman at the desk and when she learned I had a dental emergency, she immediately grabbed me a chart and penciled me into the first available slot. It was only when I calmed down a bit that I realized I hadn&#39;t researched Hebron Smiles on my beloved Yelp. I began to panic. I have a very acute fear of dentists; perhaps due to my viewing of &#39;The Dentist&#39; in 6th grade or because I have had numerous run-ins with bad ones during my lifetime. THESE are the moments--you know, the ones where you are trusting someone to hover over your open mouth with drills and needles--when Yelping really matters!<br><br>I am happy to report that I not only survived my Yelpless emergency appointment at Hebron Smiles, but I had a fantastic experience with Dr. Saleem and his staff! They offered to fix the tooth later that afternoon, but I opted to wait. One of the things I really liked about Dr. Saleem was his honesty. I have had numerous problems with this tooth and the filling that came out is very large. Instead of giving me the response I&#39;ve heard from other dentists ( &#34;That filling is really deep. You must get a root canal immediately. When would you like to give us $2000?&#34;), he was very honest about the status of the tooth and said it wasn&#39;t necessary at the moment, but it would be the wise choice because I will likely need it in the future. <br><br>I could tell that Dr. Saleem was very thorough and methodical about making sure that this gigantic filling was absolutely perfect so that I would not have problems with it in the near future. It was nice--and sadly, very rare-- to feel like this person was really taking their time to make sure you were comfortable. <br><br>Probably the most informative thing I can mention to convince you to give Dr. Saleem a try is that he is a freaking pro at maneuvering that 2-foot long needle that dentists use to deaden your mouth before drilling. I didn&#39;t feel a thing. There was the tiniest, most minuscule pinch at the beginning, but it was completely painless. Instead of pressing down quickly on the handle of the syringe (which creates that weird burning sensation and the awkward feeling of Novocaine gushing through the inside of your cheek), Dr, Saleem really took his time injecting the Novocaine and made sure that it was numb before injecting the majority of the liquid. It&#39;s a shame that D-Magazine doesn&#39;t have a &#34;Best Novocaine Shot in Dallas&#34; in their annual Best-of list, if they did, Dr. Saleem would easily win that distinction.', '', '2016-01-24 21:47:39'),

He instantly won me over after just the first appointment with his calm, NON-SALESY (it&#39;s a word) nature. I love that he didn&#39;t try to sell me teeth whitening, or fillings, or crown replacements &#34;because the ones I have seem to be failing&#34; which I&#39;ve heard from other dentists in the past...he&#39;s the real deal, an honest dentist who really cares about his patients!<br><br>Dr. Wong is so honest and trustworthy that only he was able to convince me, after my consult a year ago, that a dental implant would be my best option. He walked me through a few alternatives, told me the pros/cons to each, and told me that he would go with the dental implant if faced with the same circumstance. I&#39;m so glad he encouraged me to move forward and introduced me to Dr. Chang who did the actual implant.

Its been the worst nightmare of my life and its a nightmare that I will never be able to wake up from until I have these teeth replaced with implants.', '', '2016-01-24 22:02:00'),

Each chair has its own TV with sound so its a good distraction if you aren&#39;t a fan of getting your teeth cleaned. I&#39;ve never had this problem but thought it helped pass the time since its difficult to talk with someone cleaning your teeth. Also there are no spit sinks and they use more modern equipment to rinse and suck the water out. <br><br>Dr. O&#39;Connor has always educated me and provided tips on my cleaning to ensure I don&#39;t get any problems down the road. I had a wisdom tooth pulled and fillings which is the most extensive work other than the routine cleaning and all were great experiences. But I have never felt pressured into any service either or felt they were trying to add on more services for more money. Before I discovered Floss, I had a very bad experience with another practice and believe they lied to me and felt pressured to get a deep cleaning. I have learned my lesson to always get a second opinion if that happens again but I was young at the time and believed them.

After having a particularly expensive and terrible experience with having dental insurance a number of years ago, I decided I would no longer give my money to an insurance company and work directly with a dentist when it came to keeping my mouth healthy. Because I don&#39;t have dental insurance, the office manager set up a plan for me to pay them over time that worked well with my budget and even gave me some savings on the procedure.

Dr. Sealy drew up a plan for my root canal, which totaled over 2000 bucks. The fillings will pile on to those costs later. I was shocked.<br><br>On the way out, I was billed close to $300 for my visit (exam, x-rays, cleaning). The receptionist informed me that my insurance wouldn&#39;t pay for any of it. Wow.
